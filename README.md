## Introduction

`CMS` is an application project designed to bring academic staff members, students, and course information together `in one place`, reduce managing costs, and allow easy access and efficient/effective administration of information in a user-friendly environment. We strive to `prevent human errors` and provide comfortable working space for higher accuracy.
